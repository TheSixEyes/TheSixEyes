# Hey there, I'm Taylor  (@TheSixEyes)

> Developer. Creator. Cybersecurity enthusiast. UI perfectionist.

I’m a full-stack developer passionate about desktop and mobile applications, modular UI, and the pursuit of clean, maintainable code. With lifelong roots in computing — from my first Steam account in 2004 to today’s i9 + RTX 4090 setup — I bring both technical depth and practical experience to every project I build.

### 🔧 Tech & Tools
- **Languages & Frameworks:** C# (.NET/WPF), Kotlin, PHP, React (JSX), SQL
- **Platforms:** Windows 11, macOS, Ubuntu
- **UI & Frontend:** Storybook, Bootstrap, WPF/XAML, CSS
- **DevOps & Tools:** Git, GitHub, SSH, custom terminal configs (Oh My Posh, Rainmeter)
- **Writing:** Technical documentation, MLA formatting, peer-reviewed research synthesis

### 🛠️ Current Focus
- Building a cross-platform WPF note-taking app using .NET
- Finalizing college projects and engineering elegant UIs
- Sharpening my understanding of cybersecurity and software architecture

### 🎮 After Hours
- Running a Discord community for PC gaming & development
- Gaming: League of Legends, Genshin Impact, OSRS
- Building & optimizing strategy (in code *and* games)

Let’s build something bold, responsive, and well-documented. 🚀
