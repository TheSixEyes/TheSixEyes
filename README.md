# Hey there, I'm Taylor (@TheSixEyes)

> Developer. Creator. Cybersecurity enthusiast. UI perfectionist.

I‚Äôm a full-stack dev passionate about desktop and mobile applications, modular UI, and the pursuit of clean, maintainable code and documentation that doesn't suck. 
With lifelong roots in computing, from my first Steam account in 2004 to today‚Äôs i9 + RTX 4090 setup, I've spent tens of thousands of hours on Windows.
I bring both technical depth and practical experience to every project I build, consistently challenging myself to learn the complexities. 
I enjoy learning & tinkering using the most powerful languages.

### üîß Tech & Tools
- **Languages & Frameworks:** C#(.NET/WPF), C+, Rust, Kotlin, PHP, React (JSX), SQL, GO, Python, HTML5 & CSS, TypeScript
- **Platforms:** Windows 11, MacOS, Linux
- **UI & Frontend:** Storybook, Bootstrap, WPF/XAML, CSS, Tauri, ASP.NET
- **Writing:** Technical documentation, MLA formatting, peer-reviewed research synthesis

### üõ†Ô∏è Current Focuses
- I'm working on an extensive list of applications right now, over 80, I plan to market and sell them on Gumroad.com
- Building a cross-platform WPF note-taking app using .NET, something similar to Obsidian
- Tauri cross-platform resume building & personal finance tracking applications with extensive features
- Finalizing college projects and engineering elegant UIs
- Sharpening my understanding of cybersecurity and software architecture

### üéÆ After Hours
- I develop in my off time, most of the time. Lol.
- Running a Discord community for PC gaming & development
- Gaming: League of Legends, Genshin Impact, OSRS, DayZ, RS6, Stardew Valley, CS2, Dwarf Fortress, & many more.
- Building & optimizing strategy (in code *and* games)

Let‚Äôs build something bold, responsive, and well-documented. üöÄ
